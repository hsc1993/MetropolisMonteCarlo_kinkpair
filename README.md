## Install

The main function for simulation of this project is written in [C++](https://cplusplus.com/) and the output files are processed with [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) scripts to analyze the results. 

To compile, use the following:
g++ Main.cpp simulation/Simulation.cpp dislocation/Dislocation.cpp SegmentStressCal/SegmentStressCal.cpp -o main -std=c++11

Note that the [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) library is used for calculation. The installation procedure of this library is available in its webpage.
